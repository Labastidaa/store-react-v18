This project was built to demostrate my use of React v18, this project for now doesn't have a backend and stores some information in LocalStorage.
This is focused on the front-end and will be improved overtime.

# Usage
In order to access you need to create an Account to unlock the rest of Pages. 

Here's a list of things you could do inside the app.
- Create a temporary user (don't use any real personal data)
- Visualize all products
- Search products by name
- Visualize different categories filtering only the products from that category.
- Add products to the Cart
- Checkout: Make an order, this will be saved in "My Orders" page.
- Review your orders inside "My Orders" page and visualize all of them, you can make multiple separate orders and they will be logged. (This restarts after refreshing because is saved in Local Storage)
- Create/Delete Account.

This app can still improve a lot, as you can experience yourself the user interface is not bad but can improve in accessibility. I tried to make the flow as intuitive as possible.
A challenge I had making this app is dealing with the API. This is a resource from Platzi Fake API and a lot of people modify the products and categories.

If you find the filtered sections don't work, this was probably because other people(students) modified them inside the API
I'll leave two links to the end points of the API where you can visualize and check the current state of the data provided by this API.
I recommend checking this with Google's Chrome extension JSON Formatter for better readability of the JSON file with parsed data.
